# Habanera

This is a framework that was crystalised through several years of
working on different custom sites. This is not an "MVC" kind, sorry.
Its goal always was to be as unimposing as possible while solving many
problems typical for websites I built, which ranged in complexity from
simple page-oriented ones to complicated shops and catalogs.

There is a description in the doc directory.
